## Jiu Jitsu Technology? 🤔

We're working on building a tool that allows;
- coaches to create and share jiu-jitsu content in a normalized format
- beginners to build their first mental models of jiu-jitsu using a professional framework

This is scheduled to be released in Q1 of 2025. 

Our long-term goal is to develop a system that provides real-time data points from combat sports to athletes, tournaments, and betting leagues (for VFX, odds, and training).
