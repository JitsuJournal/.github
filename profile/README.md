# JitsuJournal? 🤔

## 🎯 Q1 2025: We're building a tool that allows
- Practitioners to create jiu-jitsu sequences using a shared and customizable database of techniques.
- Coaches to create and teach using a framework that all their students understand.
- Beginners to build their first mental models of jiu-jitsu using the shared database.
## ✅ [Waitlist + Demo](https://jitsujournal.com/)
A basic version of the sequence builder and shared technique database is available on our [landing page](https://jitsujournal.com/). Check it out and sign up now to be the first to hear about our launch! 🚀
## ⛳️ Vision
The martial arts software industry is valued at USD 200 million as of 2023 and is projected to reach USD 400 million by 2030. Almost all companies in this space target academy owners by providing them with software to manage finance, marketing, and other enterprise resources. We're taking a diffrent approach by rethinking each practitioners learning experience to actually help them maximize their potential as a martial artist.
